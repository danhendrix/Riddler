This is trying to answer the question, if 100 people are standing in random order to get on a plane, with randomly assigned seats, and the first person goes to random seat instead of his assigned seat, and after that each person goes to their assigned seat unless someone's in it, then they go to a random open seat, what are the chances that you, the 100th person in line, will go in to find your seat empty? The answer is 50%.
