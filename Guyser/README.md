Here's the question, 

You arrive at the beautiful Three Geysers National Park. You read a placard explaining that the three eponymous geysers — creatively named A, B and C — erupt at intervals of precisely two hours, four hours and six hours, respectively. However, you just got there, so you have no idea how the three eruptions are staggered. Assuming they each started erupting at some independently random point in history, what are the probabilities that A, B and C, respectively, will be the first to erupt after your arrival?

In order to represent this situation I assigned the time to A,B and C, to a random number between 1 and 120 mins for A, 240 mins for B and 360 mins for C, representing the minutes until each would go off. I then ran this scenario 1M times and reported how many times each was the lowest number. Here are the results:

A - 64%
B - 22%
C - 14%
